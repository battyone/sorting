# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

In this project, we have implemented several sorting algorithms and have done some analysis on each one of them. The implemented algorithms are as follows:
* **Merge Sort**
* **Count Sort**
* **Comb Sort**
* **Shell Sort**
* **Heap Sort**
* **Binary Insertion Sort**

Then for each of these algorithms you can analyze how long it takes to sort a given list, you may also create a gif out of the data you are trying to sort by using the gif.py module.

## Getting Started

In order to use this project you can just clone this project onto your computer as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/mwbrulhardt/sorting.git
```

## Examples 
In order to sort an array, the following code may be used as an example of how to do this. In this case, merge sort is chosen as the method for sorting.
```
import sorting.sort as sort
data = [5, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 98]
sort.merge_sort(data)
```

### Prerequisites

Some things you will need in order to use the software are:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* imageio
