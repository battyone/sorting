# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

In this project, we have implemented several sorting algorithms and have done some analysis on each one of them. The implmented algorithms are as follows:
* Merge Sort
* Count Sort
* Comb Sort
* Shell Sort
* Heap Sort
* Binary Insertion Sort
Then for each of these algorithms you can analyze how long it takes to sort a given list, you may also create a gif out of the data you are trying to sort by using the gif.py module.

## Getting Started

In order to use this project you can just clone this project onto your computer as follows:
```
git clone 
```

### Prerequisites

Some things you will need in order to use the software are:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* imageio

```
import sorting.sort as sort
data = [5, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 98]
sort.merge_sort(data)
```
